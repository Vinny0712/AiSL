        At TikTok, we&apos;re committed to maintaining an inclusive environment
        and supporting our diverse community. Inclusivity is important to us
        because when people feel included, they&apos;re more comfortable
        expressing themselves authentically, creating content, and engaging with
        others. Being truly inclusive means building products and tools for
        everyone. Our cross-functional teams work with our creator community, as
        well as disability organizations and advocates to help ensure TikTok is
        accessible to everyone.
